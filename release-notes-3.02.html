          <h3>Release,  3.02</h3>
          <h3>Nov 13 2015 </h3>
          <p>Logscape 3.02 is a critical patch, implementing a fix to performance issues that were being seen in some environments. It is reccomended all users upgrade to 3.02 at their earliest convenience. Below is a list of issues fixed in 3.02.</p>
          <h3>Additions in Logscape 3.02</h3><b>Single Value Panel</b>
          <p>This new widget is designed to give the user more control over what is displayed, it exposes a section where the users can freely add Javascript which the widget will then execute.</p><b>Performance Additions</b>
          <p>This release addresses a performance issue and changes part of the execution path. It is using a new technology to the stack called OpenHFT Chronicle [Apache 2]. The issue was around event streaming of raw data, there are 3 stages, the Indexer, AggSpace and Dashboard. In each case the default implementation is to use chronicle.</p>
          <p>To change to different impls: Dashboard, -Devent.db=chronicle, mapdb, native</p>
          <p>Indexer & AggSpace -Devent.agg.type=chronicle,mapdb,native,chronicle.queue</p><br>
          <p>To configure: chroniclemap events stored on dashboard [default]:</p>
          <p>db.replay.event.store=1000000</p>
          <p>-- this is the hot data map used to store search events that users interactivly filter, sort etc. It is shared between all users</p><br>
          <p>chroniclemap event queue on replays streamed from IndexStores->AggSpace [default[</p>
          <p>replay.agg.events=1000000</p>
          <p>-- per process shared queue</p><br>
          <h3>Fixes in Logscape 3.02</h3><b>Reshipping of Log files</b>
          <p>Fixed an issue whereby an indexer would not acknowledge having recieved a file resulting in the forwarder continually ship the file resulting in exceptionally large files.</p><b>Re-Indexing can no longer cause IDX files to bloat</b>
          <p>In edge cases re-indexes were not properly removing previous IDX files, instead appending to them.</p><b>Persistit Corruption</b>
          <p>When Logscape was deployed on Windows machines it was possible for file locks to remain on persistit files, preventing the index being rebuilt.</p><b>Integer Parse exceptions</b>
          <p>Multiline events were not being properly stored within the IDX filesystem resulting in Integer parse exceptions.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
