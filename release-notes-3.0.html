          <p>Logscape 3.0 Introduces many new features as well as bug fixes, a full run down of new features can be found below.</p><b>Event Analyser</b>
          <p>The Event Analyser can be accessed via the plus symbol next to each search result; offering a snapshot summary of the data within the event. This provides insights into how this data relates to the rest of your search; including a percentage bar chart which shows value weightings. It also gives users the ability to seamlessly filter against their search using a specific value from an event</p><b>Data Driven Workspaces</b>
          <p>We've built upon the functionality first introduced with the linked workspaces, and we've made it even more powerful. You can still pass your context, but we've added tools to help you control what is displayed. Filter the entire workspace, or only specific widgets with the new interactive filtering. You can also use the new Event Analyser on the table widget to see how your data relates to the rest of your search. Workspaces continue to become more powerful and flexible, yet remain simple enough for anyone to build one.</p><b>Structured Event View</b>
          <p>The new 'Structured Event' view breaks each event down into its component parts, sorted by the field type, whether it be system, discovered or synthetic. This offers the user a visual aid to see how the Datatype is breaking up their data, and should make the entire search process more intuitive to newer users.</p><b>Post Aggregate-Functions</b>
          <p>Logscape 3 introduces post-aggregate functions, these powerful functions allow you to perform post analysis flawlessly, they work by applying an alias to the return of a function, this alias can then be used to perform additional functions.</p><b>Collectors</b>
          <p>Collectors are a new way to get your data into Logscape 3. Their function is similar to forwarders, however they're much lighter on resources and can be configured in moments. A collector will run whichever apps you configure it for, and ship the logs these apps generate via syslog to an index store. Collectors are great to gather metrics quickly, reducing worries about the resources required for a forwarder.</p><b>Instant CSV extraction</b>
          <p>Have you ever wished you could load your data into Logscape and be done with it? Well now when you're dealing with CSV data that's exactly what you can do. When CSV data is ingested the header row is located and extracted automatically. Whenever you search the file, the column headers will be available to you as fields. </p><b>New Charting Libraries</b>
          <p>We're happy to introduce the D3Pie and C3 charting libraries. With versatile settings and stunning graphics, we hope everyone will love and make use of the new libraries to their fullest. You can add the power of sub-charts to your workspaces, or add extra grid lines for greater clarity</p><b>Zoning Improvements</b>
          <p>Zoning can now either be set to strict or lazy. When a zone is set to strict, data will never be shipped outside of the zone. Lazy zones will pass data up through zones until an index store or manager is found. This allows administrators to lock data into geographical regions, while still offering the possibility for environment wide index stores</p><b>Korean and Japanese support</b>
          <p>Logscape 3 introduces the Korean and Japanese languages, these translations can be selected on the login page.</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
